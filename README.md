# 🧠 VelOptix AI Research Lab

**VelOptix** is an independent AI research lab founded and run by a solo researcher, focused on building intelligent, ultra-efficient optimizers for real-world machine learning systems.

We aim to solve critical challenges in deep learning optimization — from convergence instability and hardware inefficiency to non-stationary data and deployment constraints.
